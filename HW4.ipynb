(AFP)From Pakistani propaganda to countering politicians, comments on top Facebook pages are resetting the narrativeIn February, following a terrorist attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers, and retaliatory air strikes by India on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, the two nuclear-armed neighbours were on the brink of war.As tensions heightened at the border, netizens of the two nations were fighting another war on Facebook. Pakistani users flooded the comment section of some of India’s most followed media pages: they called out journalists (“Itz now officiaL, US says no indian fighter jet has capability to hit F-16. And here in india its media and iaf keeps spreading fake propaganda against PAF.\"); they challenged the claims made by Indian authorities (“BREAKING: Indian Jets dropped some massive tomatoes in Pakistan injuring 5 trees.\"); they heaped praise on their Prime Minister Imran Khan and ridiculed India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi (“See the difference between the two national leaders An Oxford graduate And a tea seller.\").In volume terms, Indians outnumbered Pakistanis on these pages. But nationality is irrelevant for Facebook’s comment ranking algorithm: the counter-narrative offered by Pakistanis—“liked\" hundreds of times by their fellow countrymen—occupied the top position in the “most relevant\" comment display, Facebook’s ranking order where the “most engaging comments\" are shown first—often those “with the most likes and replies\".Some Indians were visibly uncomfortable: one issued a warning to not be swayed by their posts (“There are lot of Pakistani guys who are commenting on our news posts and misguiding us constantly.. be careful!\"); another wanted them to be blocked (“can you block these Pakistanis from commenting on this link My blood boils to see them commenting.\").But that’s not how the internet works. While news channels can decide whom they want to invite on their debates; newspaper journalists can choose the sources they interview; and politicians can do away with engagement altogether—such control is rarely visible on the comment section of Facebook. It is open to all.And what gets said matters because while a top comment on a popular page may garner 2,000 “likes\", the average interaction (like, angry, love and sad, etc.) on a Times of India post is only about 120. With the introduction of algorithmic ranking which prioritizes “engagement\", the right Facebook comment at the right time on the right page is the new gateway to mass attention on the internet.Mint reviewed the “most relevant\" comments on the 50 most commented posts shared over the last six months on 18 popular Indian Facebook pages (see graphic for the complete list). It includes the most followed mainstream media pages in English and Hindi, accounts of national and regional politicians, and partisan political pages.\n",

      "Modi’s strong response to the Pulwama and Uri terrorist attacks may have high recall value for the Indian public when they elect the next governmentModi had spoken tough on terrorism emanating from Pakistan well before he assumed office on 26 May 2014, and subsequently tooNEW DELHI: Akey engagement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 February was dedicating the National War Memorial to the nation. Modi was at his fiery best, slamming the opposition for compromising national security through delayed acquisitions of military hardware and corrupt procurement procedures. There was nothing in his demeanour to suggest that India would in the space of less than 12 hours, in the early hours of 26 February, be using its Air Force to conduct an air strike inside Pakistani territory, something that last happened in the 1971 war with Pakistan. To his immediate and wider audience, Modi’s speech seemed typical of him, turning tables on his detractors who have accused him of helping big business win spin-off projects from defence deals.A person familiar with the events of 25 February said Modi returned to his official residence past 9pm. “We were later told that the prime minister did not go to sleep as he usually does by midnight but was awake well past that time,\" said the person mentioned above. “It was a little before 3am on Tuesday (26 February) that the prime minister was informed that our fighter aircraft had taken off for their mission,\" the person said.It was past 4am on 26 February morning when Mirage 2000 jets of the Indian Air Force returned to their base after bombing a terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The person quoted above said Modi spoke to one of the pilots who took part in the strike, as well as the Air Force officer in charge of the Gwalior base from where the fighter jets had taken off.It was decided that foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale would make an official announcement to convey to the country and to the international audience that India’s air strike was a “pre-emptive\" counter-terrorism operation in the face of “imminent\" danger of another possible terror attack and not a military one and that it came against the backdrop of a suicide attack on 14 February in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama region in which 40 paramilitary soldiers were killed.\n",

      "Intelligence units are on high alert over the rising instances of encounters between militants and security forces following the suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama on 14 February that killed 40 personnel of the force. However, this has not deterred the Congress-NC alliance, the PDP and the BJP from firming up their campaign plans to win as many of the six Lok Sabha seats from the state, albeit with an eye on the assembly elections.The Congress-NC alliance is working hard to increase its tally in the Kashmir valley. NC president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah had lost to PDP’s Tariq Hameed Karra in Srinagar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but had subsequently won the 2017 bypoll to the constituency defeating Nazir Ahmed Khan of the PDP.The PDP , which has only one member of Parliament (MP) in Muzaffar Hussain Baig who represents the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency, may find little support on the ground. Its government fell in June 2018, following the BJP’s decision to walk out of the alliance between the two parties in the state. Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti has, however, decided to contest from Anantnag, which has been vacant since she resigned in April 2016. The party is also readying to field a strong candidate to take on Abdullah in the pivotal Srinagar seat. The party has, however, agreed to stay away from the Udhampur constituency so that secular votes are not divided.The BJP, which had won the Ladakh, Udhampur and Jammu constituencies in the Jammu region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with a vote share of 23%, aims to make inroads into the valley. However, political analysts believe that it will be an uphill task for the saffron party to win as many seats this time.\n",

Kumaraswamy that he works like a clerk and that he has no independence show the problems they have. Their problems, disgruntlement, mutual distrust will have an impact on parliament elections.The achievements of the Modi government, the failure of the coalition in Karnataka and our (BJP’s) hard work will all be beneficial to us. Though there is a drought, they (coalition) are doing nothing and only speak about the farm loan waiver. Modi government has given ?6,000 direct income transfer to farmers. Income tax relief has been given to the middle class with several concessions and a lot has been done for the labour community. These are the issues that people are talking about. The fact that there is no PM candidate from the opposition is also beneficial for us. Lakhs of youngsters, irrespective of caste and community, are supporting Modi.Nothing has been finalized yet and we will complete this process in a few weeks. We finished one round of discussions with (BJP chief) Amit Shah. Another one will take place soon as we are left with only seven weeks for the elections.

      "With the introduction of algorithmic ranking which prioritizes?‘engagement’, the?right Facebook comment at the right time is the new gateway to mass attention on the internet. (AFP)From Pakistani propaganda to countering politicians, comments on top Facebook pages are resetting the narrativeIn February, following a terrorist attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed that killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers, and retaliatory air strikes by India on a terrorist training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot, the two nuclear-armed neighbours were on the brink of war.As tensions heightened at the border, netizens of the two nations were fighting another war on Facebook. Pakistani users flooded the comment section of some of India’s most followed media pages: they called out journalists (“Itz now officiaL, US says no indian fighter jet has capability to hit F-16. And here in india its media and iaf keeps spreading fake propaganda against PAF.\"); they challenged the claims made by Indian authorities (“BREAKING: Indian Jets dropped some massive tomatoes in Pakistan injuring 5 trees.\"); they heaped praise on their Prime Minister Imran Khan and ridiculed India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi (“See the difference between the two national leaders An Oxford graduate And a tea seller.\").In volume terms, Indians outnumbered Pakistanis on these pages. But nationality is irrelevant for Facebook’s comment ranking algorithm: the counter-narrative offered by Pakistanis—“liked\" hundreds of times by their fellow countrymen—occupied the top position in the “most relevant\" comment display, Facebook’s ranking order where the “most engaging comments\" are shown first—often those “with the most likes and replies\".Some Indians were visibly uncomfortable: one issued a warning to not be swayed by their posts (“There are lot of Pakistani guys who are commenting on our news posts and misguiding us constantly.. be careful!\"); another wanted them to be blocked (“can you block these Pakistanis from commenting on this link My blood boils to see them commenting.\").But that’s not how the internet works. While news channels can decide whom they want to invite on their debates; newspaper journalists can choose the sources they interview; and politicians can do away with engagement altogether—such control is rarely visible on the comment section of Facebook. It is open to all.And what gets said matters because while a top comment on a popular page may garner 2,000 “likes\", the average interaction (like, angry, love and sad, etc.) on a Times of India post is only about 120. With the introduction of algorithmic ranking which prioritizes “engagement\", the right Facebook comment at the right time on the right page is the new gateway to mass attention on the internet.Mint reviewed the “most relevant\" comments on the 50 most commented posts shared over the last six months on 18 popular Indian Facebook pages (see graphic for the complete list). It includes the most followed mainstream media pages in English and Hindi, accounts of national and regional politicians, and partisan political pages.\n",

      "Modi’s strong response to the Pulwama and Uri terrorist attacks may have high recall value for the Indian public when they elect the next governmentModi had spoken tough on terrorism emanating from Pakistan well before he assumed office on 26 May 2014, and subsequently tooNEW DELHI: Akey engagement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 25 February was dedicating the National War Memorial to the nation. Modi was at his fiery best, slamming the opposition for compromising national security through delayed acquisitions of military hardware and corrupt procurement procedures. There was nothing in his demeanour to suggest that India would in the space of less than 12 hours, in the early hours of 26 February, be using its Air Force to conduct an air strike inside Pakistani territory, something that last happened in the 1971 war with Pakistan. To his immediate and wider audience, Modi’s speech seemed typical of him, turning tables on his detractors who have accused him of helping big business win spin-off projects from defence deals.A person familiar with the events of 25 February said Modi returned to his official residence past 9pm. “We were later told that the prime minister did not go to sleep as he usually does by midnight but was awake well past that time,\" said the person mentioned above. “It was a little before 3am on Tuesday (26 February) that the prime minister was informed that our fighter aircraft had taken off for their mission,\" the person said.It was past 4am on 26 February morning when Mirage 2000 jets of the Indian Air Force returned to their base after bombing a terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The person quoted above said Modi spoke to one of the pilots who took part in the strike, as well as the Air Force officer in charge of the Gwalior base from where the fighter jets had taken off.It was decided that foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale would make an official announcement to convey to the country and to the international audience that India’s air strike was a “pre-emptive\" counter-terrorism operation in the face of “imminent\" danger of another possible terror attack and not a military one and that it came against the backdrop of a suicide attack on 14 February in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama region in which 40 paramilitary soldiers were killed.\n",

      "Intelligence units are on high alert over the rising instances of encounters between militants and security forces following the suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama on 14 February that killed 40 personnel of the force. However, this has not deterred the Congress-NC alliance, the PDP and the BJP from firming up their campaign plans to win as many of the six Lok Sabha seats from the state, albeit with an eye on the assembly elections.The Congress-NC alliance is working hard to increase its tally in the Kashmir valley. NC president and former chief minister Farooq Abdullah had lost to PDP’s Tariq Hameed Karra in Srinagar in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, but had subsequently won the 2017 bypoll to the constituency defeating Nazir Ahmed Khan of the PDP.The PDP , which has only one member of Parliament (MP) in Muzaffar Hussain Baig who represents the Baramulla Lok Sabha constituency, may find little support on the ground. Its government fell in June 2018, following the BJP’s decision to walk out of the alliance between the two parties in the state. Former chief minister and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti has, however, decided to contest from Anantnag, which has been vacant since she resigned in April 2016. The party is also readying to field a strong candidate to take on Abdullah in the pivotal Srinagar seat. The party has, however, agreed to stay away from the Udhampur constituency so that secular votes are not divided.The BJP, which had won the Ladakh, Udhampur and Jammu constituencies in the Jammu region in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections with a vote share of 23%, aims to make inroads into the valley.

      "Home-grown smartphone brands like Micromax and Intex once cornered 54% of market share. That is down to less than 10% todaymint-india-wire long-reads xiaomi smartphonesoppo smartphonessmartphonesmicromax mobile phonesintex phonelava smartphonesLavaVivo smartphonesTranssionSamsungnokiasmartphoneschinachinese smartphonesFour years ago, Micromax’s office in Gurugram was at par with the likes of Google. The multi-storeyed building had open spaces, rooms aplenty, and even balconies and terraces where parties could be thrown.Today, the company operates out of a single floor in a common office complex in Gurugram. The once-swanky office now has only a few cabins, far fewer employees, and is quite cramped. Incidentally, in 2014, Counterpoint Research put Micromax at the helm of the booming Indian smartphone market. It even surpassed Samsung, and shipped more phones than any other brand in India. In fact, home-grown smartphone brands such as Micromax, Lava, and Intex once cornered nearly 54% of the market share. The same brands have a less than 10% market share today. What really happened?A look back at the last few years shows home-grown smartphone brands losing their dominance to a gradual Chinese onslaught. Today, the top player in India is Xiaomi, accounting for 29.7% of all smartphone shipments (IDC data). The company—which introduced itself with competitively priced devices—has slowly built its base in the country over the past five years, and is now reaping the benefits.In fact, according to data from IDC, four of the top five smartphone brands in India are from China—Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Transsion hold the 1st, 3rd, 4th and 5th positions, respectively. Samsung, which ousted Nokia from the Indian market, remains at number two, but is feeling the heat as well.Meanwhile, Intex (which did not offer comment for this story) and Micromax have both been selling consumer appliances. Micromax says it sells nearly a million TVs every year, while Intex’s website proudly declares itself to be the number one Indian LED TV brand. Intex has also dabbled with air-conditioners and speakers.Chinese brands have always offered low prices, and they continue to do so. However, the market has also changed. Now, the low pricing of devices has become the bar that others have to compete against.In one of its launch events in China some months ago, Lei Jun, CEO of Xiaomi, had said that if his company makes more than 5% net profit from its hardware business, it would aim to pass that benefit on to its customers.According to an industry source closely involved with smartphone sales, Oppo and Vivo sell phones in India at a margin of about 12%. These two companies have traditionally sold phones at higher prices than Xiaomi, since they plied their trade in an offline-centric model in India.In the offline space, companies incur higher overheads, which raise the overall cost of the device, and hence, the final price too. According to a distributor who requested anonymity, when Oppo and Vivo started dominating the offline segment, they were paying lots of money to retailers and distributors to keep their brands visible. Yet, that wouldn’t reflect on the prices of the actual products. “They would even pay for redecorating a retailer’s store,\" the source said.\n",

      "AI algorithms keep a track of your activity and usage and keep apps from running in the background to reduce power consumption and keeping your RAM from getting full so that it can quickly run apps whenever required.Voice assistants, however, made the presence of more prominent this year. Be it Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, virtual assistants became considerably smarter this year. They can now do things that would’ve left you gaping merely five years ago—from making quick calculations and ordering groceries online to executing incredibly complex commands like booking hotel reservations for you.Software experience also changed in 2018. When Apple announced the gesture-based navigation for the iPhone X last year, Google was stuck with its primitive three button navigation. Custom UIs based on Android quickly caught on with this by providing their own rendition of gesture-based navigation. The latest version of Android (Pie) finally made it official on stock Android.But that wasn’t the only thing that changed. Several security and privacy features were added to the new version along with Digital Wellness, which is aimed at reducing the amount of time people spend on their smartphones.While all of these trends are based on the majority of the smartphones that came out this year, there were certainly a few outliers like the Razer Phone 2 with a metal back, LED accent lights and a 120Hz display. Huawei’s Mate 20 Pro comes with wireless reverse charging technology which lets you charge another Qi charging compliant smartphone through its back. We also saw a satellite smartphone, the X5-Touch, from a UAE based company called Thuraya.2018 saw the little slab of metal, glass and semiconductor transform into something that’s not just functional, but aesthetically pleasing. It’s probably the second step into the future. And given that technologies like foldable displays and 5G are in their nascent stages, we can definitely expect an exciting new year.mint-india-wire smartphonessmartphones in 2018best smartphones in 2018iphone xsiphone xs maxoneplus 6thuawei mate 20 prosamsung galaxy note 9Realme 2 proOppo R17 ProVivo V11 Proin display finger print scannerfacial unlockingAndroid PieAndroid OreoGesture navigation5Gfoldable displays\n",

A politics that dreams of a society that truly values individual rights, inclusive development and progressive thinking\".In a country where the median age is 28, and where 15 million young people aged 18 or 19 are likely to vote for the first time, those words may well sum up the zeitgeist of a New India.In reality, though, their voice has barely risen above the din, completely drowned by the cacophony of grizzly politicians, who are cynically exploiting every available fault-line between communities, castes and ethnic groupings with the sole objective of garnering more votes. In this milieu, rabid acrimony has marked the buildup to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.In this no-holds-barred slugfest for political one-upmanship, the most dangerous strand has been dragging the armed forces into the election narrative. With sundry retired generals, particularly those past their prime, jumping into the fray, the politicization of the military, if it becomes any more pronounced, could end up acquiring menacing proportions in the future.\n",

(AP)According to the private Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), 90 percent of around 10 million jobs lost last year were held by womenWhile Modi remains the favourite in general elections, insufficient employment is a major voter worryCHINCHOLI: A few years ago, in this sweltering corner of western India, the horizon was dotted with hunched, barefoot women swinging sickles all day to cut wheat for the spring harvest.Now, a giant green harvester clears an entire half-acre field within minutes, allowing farmers to save money and quickly sell the wheat, typically used to make Indian flat breads.Chhaya Kharade, 36, and other women doing lighter farm work were gradually replaced by the machines that now crisscross wheat, sugar cane and onion fields surrounding Chincholi, a village 190 km (120 miles) east of India's financial hub of Mumbai.\"I should be busy now, as the wheat harvesting is going on. But there is hardly any work for me. Almost all farmers are using machines,\" Kharade said in her spartan two-room house.Indian women, especially those working in precarious informal sectors, are at the sharp end of what economists and opposition politicians describe as a jobs crisis in India. According to the private Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), 90 percent of around 10 million jobs lost last year were held by women.Several unemployed women interviewed by Reuters said they had soured on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist who swept to power in 2014 vowing to turn India into an economic powerhouse but has struggled to create jobs.\n",
